## Introduction

For lots of us our tech roles feel vocational. We have that moment where we realise that we can actually get paid for doing the things we enjoy such as coding, tinkering with servers or designing things.

So when we consider management it is often viewed as a fork in the road on our careers.

* Route one - do we become more technical, exploring routes like architect or "Senior" {insert role her}, Principle Consultant those kinds of things.
* Route Two - do we become managers. Scaling that hierarchy. Leading people and managing their mindset.

The problem with this is we tend to take approaches of reduction based decision making in deciding which route is right for us.
