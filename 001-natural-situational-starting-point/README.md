# 001 Your situational starting point

[Full Detail in Article](https://dev.to/eggsy84/tech-lead-katas-001-your-situational-starting-point-171b)

## Introduction
[Situational leadership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pykuvuA-QFU) is a great tool for leading technical teams. Utilising situational leadership you can transform the progress of an individual and their own development.

To apply situational leadership I think you have to first start with yourself. Understanding your own take on the leadership approaches and where you naturally start.

## Notes

### Types of Leadership

**Directing** - High Directive behaviour, Low Supportive behaviour	
	
* Autocratic - leader makes all the decisions

**Coaching** - High Directive behaviour, High Supportive behaviour	
	
* Coaching - Leader defines roles and task, but more receptive to feedback

**Supporting** - Low Directive behaviour, High Supportive behaviour
	
* “Quiet” - leader makes some decisions, but most made by the team

**Delegating** - Low Directive behaviour, Low Supportive behaviour	
	
* “Hands Off” - Responsible for the team, but minimal interaction. Concerned with the vision more than the day-to-day.


### Levels of Employee Development

**D1 - Enthusiastic Beginner**

* Low competence, High commitment


**D2 - Disillusioned Learner**

* High competence, Low commitment


**D3 - Capable but Cautious**

* High competence, Variable commitment


**D4 - Self-reliant Achiever**

* High competence, high commitment

*This may change day to day, task to task!*

### Mapping Development level to leadership styles

* D1 > Directing
* D2 > Coaching
* D3 > Supporting
* D4 > Delegating

## My natural situational starting point

I actively try to avoid **Directing**. I think the reasons will be explained in the coming reflections on other styles to follow.

Thinking through recent and memorable situations, I have condcluded I _generally_ lean towards **Coaching**. I believe this to be my bias towards a coaching culture, that I believe facilitates an autonomous and self-sufficient workplace and society, while providing the support and direction required from me as a leader. 

I sometimes find myself adopting a **Supporting** approach, I would rather help others understand the "why" and let them work out the "how" and demonstrate the "what" - I never know everything and rarely know best! I can provide guidance or my take on things, but try not to limit the bounds of others ideas and solutions. This does often depend on the others involved and their experience in the situation, not everybody has the confidence to 'just do it' on their own every time.

**Delegating** is something I remind myself to do more of, although I prefer to make it more about empowering than delegating (to avoid "just handing things off"). Somebody can be given the responsibility of getting something done, the autonomy to do so however they like, but may often need and should be provided the support and guidance where necessary.

## Reflections

### Reflection 1

In a recent discussion with an engineer in our team, I wanted them to invite a soon-to-be new joiner to an upcoming team social. The engineer confirmed it would be fine to do so, so I asked them to go ahead and go it.

I **delegated** the task.


### Reflection 2

In a recent project our team was involved in, I discussed the objective of the project along with some background and context about why the project mattered. I was then due to take annual leave for one week, during which the team scoped the tasks and got to work on them while I was away.

I would call this a cross between **Supporting** and **Delegating**.

## Iterations & Improvements

### Reflection 1 (continuted from above)

Looking back at this situation (and thanks for some feedback from the engineer mentioned!), I feel I actually should have been more **directive**. In an attempt to **coach** the individual by giving them the responsibility to get it done and empower them to work out the best way to do so, I actually made things more confusing. Being the first time the engineer had been tasked with this kind of work, not knowing the process for doing some (in did involve getting somebodies personal information, in fairness) [*enthusiastic begineer*]. I didn't make it clear enough what I wanted to be done.

A member of another team ended up bringing the request to me in the end, which was fine - but the best part is that the engineer actually did (as sort of expected) come up with a different (and **better**) approach that I plan to adopt it future!

### Reflection 2 (continuted from above)

This process worked really well in my opinion! I tried not to think to much about how it would go and just trust the team to do what they do best. The team was really well self-organised and quickly scoped, estimated, planned and made progress of the tasks. They identified some problems I hadn't thought of, they solved some of the problems in new ways and for the things they did know they made sure it got done the best it could be. I would say the team showed themselves as *self-reliant achievers*.

I'd like to do more of this where possible, but need to keep the different development levels in mind so that the most appropriate leadership style is used and so that the situational starting point doesn't take over!
